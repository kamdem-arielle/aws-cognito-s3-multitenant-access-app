 # AWS Cognito S3 Multitenant Access App

This project demonstrates how to implement secure multi-tenant access to an Amazon S3 bucket using AWS Cognito, IAM Roles, and Prefix-based S3 access. Each tenant (Client A, Client B) has isolated access to their data based on their identity and group membership in Cognito.

## 🌐 Live Demo
- The site hasn't yet been deployed.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔐 Cognito User Pool with groups (Client A and B)
- 🆔 Identity Pool with role-based access
- 🎯 IAM policies restricting access to S3 prefixes
- 🪣 S3 bucket structured with prefixes for data isolation
- 💻 Angular frontend via Cognito
- 🧱 Infrastructure as code using AWS CDK

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **AWS S3** – Secure object storage
- **AWS Cognito** – User authentication and identity federation
- **IAM** – Role-based access management
- **AWS CDK** – Infrastructure as code
- **Angular** – Frontend integration
- **GitHub Actions / Bitbucket Pipelines** – Deployment automation
